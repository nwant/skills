# skill directory each agent harness actually reads:
#   - ~/.claude/skills:          Claude Code
#   - $CODEX_HOME/skills:        Codex (defaults to ~/.codex/skills)
#   - ~/.agents/skills:          other Agent Skills-compatible harnesses
# Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` is all that's needed
# to keep installed skills up to date, and an edit is live in the next session.
#
# Codex reads $CODEX_HOME/skills, NOT ~/.agents/skills: its bundled
# skill-installer installs to "$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name> (defaults to
# ~/.codex/skills)". Linking only into ~/.agents/skills leaves Codex seeing
# none of these. Codex's own bundled skills live in a `.system` subdirectory
# there and are never touched, since no skill in this repo is named `.system`.
